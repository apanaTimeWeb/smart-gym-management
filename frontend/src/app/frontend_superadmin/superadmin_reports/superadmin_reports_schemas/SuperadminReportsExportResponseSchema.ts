 * RESPONSIBILITY: Module-owned TypeScript module SuperadminReportsExportResponseSchema owned by the superadmin_reports feature boundary.

 * STATE DEPENDENCIES: No React/client state primitive detected.
 * MODULE DEPENDENCIES: zod
 * EDGE CASES: Preserve implemented loading, empty, error, disabled, cancellation, retry, and repeated-action behavior.
 * REPAIR CONSTRAINT: Cross-feature business dependencies require explicit documentation; do not move business logic into global UI infrastructure.
