# Manager Manager_Navigation Module Theme Contract

This contract belongs only to `src/app/manager/manager_navigation`. It records the exact global semantic theme variables consumed by the current implementation. The global design system remains the visual source of truth.

## Consumed Global Semantic Tokens

| CSS Variable | Current Usage |
| --- | --- |
| None | No semantic theme tokens are directly consumed; inherited shell styling still follows the global design system. |

## Binding Rules

- No raw hex colors, arbitrary Tailwind color values, or raw RGBA colors may be introduced into module JSX.
- Semantic background opacity modifiers such as `bg-success/10` and `bg-primary/20` are forbidden.
- Solid semantic backgrounds require the appropriate documented on-color; otherwise use the subtle `*-bg` variant.
- Feature-specific business status mappings remain local to this feature.
- No feature-local CSS variable is defined by this module unless explicitly documented here.

## Portability

When this feature is copied to another compatible application, define the listed semantic variables through that application's canonical global theme stylesheet and preserve the same semantic meanings.
