# Trainer Feature Map

## Module Purpose
Handles trainer operations, UI display, and logic isolation as part of the Smart Gym 360 platform.

## Directory Structure
- `trainer_components/`: Contains all isolated micro-components for the module.
- `trainer_types/` (if applicable): TypeScript definitions.
- `trainer_utils/` (if applicable): Shared constants and hardcoded data.
- `trainer_context/` (if applicable): Module-scoped React Context or Zustand store.

## Feature Inventory
| Feature | Path | Purpose | Main API Calls | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Core UI | `/trainer` | Main module view | TBD | Frontend Team |

## Data and State Architecture
- Server-state query keys: `['trainer']`
- Zustand stores: TBD
- Context providers: TBD
- Local-storage keys: TBD
- MSW handler file: TBD

## API Contract
List all endpoint builders and expected response types.
- `fetchTrainer(params)`
- `createTrainer(dto)`
- `updateTrainer(id, dto)`
- `deleteTrainer(id)`

## Permissions and Security
Document protected actions, roles, and CODEOWNERS paths.

## Loading, Empty, Error States
- **Loading:** Uses `loading.tsx` skeleton matching global design.
- **Empty:** Follows Rule 48 (dedicated empty state component).
- **Error:** Uses `error.tsx` typed React Error Boundary.

## Edge Cases / AI Warnings
- Do not bypass API interceptors.
- Do not mix complex React logic (`useEffect`) with JSX markup.
